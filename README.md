# fa_kit
Factor Analysis Kit

I've re-written various factor analysis tools for my own use several times over the years, so I'm trying to come up with a single factor analysis package that does everything I want.

`./fa_test` contains the main package
`./tests` contains pytest unit tests
`./examples` has Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the package




Up next to-do:
* Tensorflow Extraction/PAF
* Plotting functions
    * Scree plots
    * Factor outputs
* Labelling for dimensions
    * label-sorting options
* Pandas input/output
* Demo notebooks
* Clean docstrings and readmes
