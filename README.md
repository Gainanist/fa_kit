Factor Analysis Kit

I've re-written various factor analysis tools for my own use several times over the years, so I'm trying to come up with a single factor analysis package that does everything I want.

Up next to-do:
* Tensorflow PAF
* Showing scree plots
* Pandas input and labelling
* Clean docstrings and readmes
* Demo notebooks
